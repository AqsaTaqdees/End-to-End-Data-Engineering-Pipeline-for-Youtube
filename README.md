📊 End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Pipeline-for-Youtube
Overview:
End-to-end YouTube Data Analysis pipeline using AWS (S3, Lambda, Glue, QuickSight). Ingests raw JSON/CSV, transforms to Parquet, and visualizes insights on top videos, engagement, and trends via interactive dashboards.

Introduction:
This repository contains a fully developed, end-to-end data pipeline project that ingests, processes, and analyzes YouTube video performance data using AWS services. The project is designed to handle both structured (CSV) and semi-structured (JSON) data, transform it into an analysis-ready format, and deliver actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

🚀 Project Highlights
- Cloud-Based ETL Pipeline using AWS Lambda, Glue, S3, and Athena
- Amazon Redshift for scalable, high-performance analytical querying
- Object Storage (S3) for raw JSON/CSV ingestion
- Columnar Storage (Parquet) for optimized queries
- Glue Data Catalog to organize and define schema for the datasets
- Athena for serverless querying and analysis
- QuickSight Dashboard for visual analytics
- Insights into top videos, engagement trends, regional performance.

📁 Project Structure
/etl-scripts/        --> PySpark & Lambda functions for transformation
/raw-data/           --> Sample JSON/CSV files
/cleansed-data/      --> Converted Parquet files
/dashboard/          --> QuickSight assets or screenshots
/sql-queries/        --> Athena queries

🔧 Technologies Used
- AWS S3 – Object and columnar storage
- AWS Lambda – Serverless compute for ingestion
- AWS Glue – ETL orchestration and cataloging
- AWS Athena – Serverless querying over S3 data
